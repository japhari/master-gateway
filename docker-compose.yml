    # RabbitMQ is expected to be provided externally (host install or another stack).
    # In Docker, set queueServer.host in src/config/mediator.json to a reachable
    # hostname/IP, for example:
    #   - host.docker.internal  (RabbitMQ on the Docker host)
    #   - an IP / DNS name for a remote RabbitMQ instance
